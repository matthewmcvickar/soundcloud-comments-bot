# SoundCloud Said

**[@soundcloudsaid](https://twitter.com/soundcloudsaid)**

A Twitter bot that tweets random comments from SoundCloud.

---

As a lover of music I spend a lot of time on SoundCloud, and can't help but notice the comments. SoundCloud comments have a certain character: a lot of concise and enthusiastic praise, a ton of spam, the occasional multi-sentence opinion on the production, and, rarely, a negative review.

This bot grabs a comment at random.


## How I Built It

### Getting Random Comments

At first I struggled with how to retrieve a random commentâ€”the SoundCloud API doesn't allow for getting random nodes. Then I discovered that track IDs (and comment IDs) are sequential. I found an old comment ID at [100000000](http://api.soundcloud.com/comments/100000000?client_id=f189440f42d14bfcf0a708703782cefc), a recent one at [290000000](http://api.soundcloud.com/comments/290000000?client_id=f189440f42d14bfcf0a708703782cefc), and figured that 190 million comments was more than enough of a well from which to draw.

The script picks a number at random and checks if that comment still exists, then either proceeds with evaluating the comment or moves on to another random comment if it doesn't exist.

### Filtering Comments

My aesthetic for this bot is simple, text-only, anonymous. So I filter the potential comments rigorously. I filter out the following:

  - self-promotion (anything including the words `follow`, `check out`, `blog`, and any of a half-dozen social networks)
  - classic spam (`free`, `dollars`, `cam`, `sex`)
  - anything that looks like a URL
  - replies and mentions (anything including the `@` symbol)
  - anything pointing to another user or track on SoundCloud

I also filter out any comment including any of the [bad words listed in Darius Kazemi's wordfilter](https://github.com/dariusk/wordfilter/blob/master/lib/badwords.json).

Finally, I use a [https://www.npmjs.com/package/cld](language detection library) to ensure the comment is English. The library is imperfect and error-prone, but helps discard the comments that obviously aren't English. The reason I do this is to prevent abusive language appearing in my bot in a language I don't speak and can't filter for.

### Tweeting SoundCloud Comments

The [`soundcloud-comments-bot.js`](soundcloud-comments-bot.js) script does the following:

1. Chooses a comment at random from SoundCloud. Checks whether a comment actually exists at that ID.

2. Filters the comment using the criteria listed above.

3. If it passes muster, tweet the comment.

This script is running on Heroku.

## Acknowledgements

I could not have created this bot without help from the following people and resources:

- [Justin Falcone](http://twitter.com/modernserf) provided code review.

- [Camille Darroux](https://twitter.com/berlindisaster/status/621943270726344704) also had this idea in July of 2015. (I didn't know until I Googled for it just after launching this bot.)


## Afterward

This is my third Twitter bot. ([@obliquestions](https://twitter.com/obliquestions) and [@novelcompounds](https://twitter.com/novelcompounds) are the first two.)
