# SoundCloud Comments Bot

A bot that posts random comments from SoundCloud.

Currently posting several times a day to Mastodon. (It used to post to Twitter,
but I don't use Twitter anymore and neither do my bots.)

As a lover of music, I spend a lot of time on SoundCloud, and can't help but
notice the comments. SoundCloud comments have a certain character: a lot of
concise and enthusiastic praise, a ton of spam, the occasional multi-sentence
opinion on the production, and, rarely, a negative review.

This bot grabs a comment at random.

## How It Works

### Getting Random Comments

GitHub Actions is configured to run the [`bot.js`](bot.js) script on a fixed
schedule throughout the day. That script does the following:

1. Chooses a track at random from SoundCloud. Checks whether the track still
   exists and if it has any comments. If either is untrue, get another track at
   random. Retry until we get a track with comments.

2. Check all comments using the criteria listed in the 'Filtering Comments'
   section below. If none are usable, go back to step one.

3. Randomly select one of the comments that is usable and post it!

### Filtering Comments

My aesthetic for this bot is simple, text-only, anonymous. So I filter the
potential comments rigorously. I filter out the following:

- self-promotion (anything including the words `follow`, `check out`, `blog`,
  and any of a half-dozen social networks)
- classic spam (`free`, `dollars`, `cam`, `sex`)
- anything that looks like a URL
- replies and mentions (anything including the `@` symbol)
- anything pointing to another user or track on SoundCloud

I also filter out any comment including any of the [bad words listed in Darius Kazemi's wordfilter](https://github.com/dariusk/wordfilter/blob/master/lib/badwords.json).

Finally, I use the [Google Translate API](https://cloud.google.com/translate) to
make sure the comment is English. The automated check is imperfect for checking
informal, comment-style language, but helps discard most non-English comments.
The primary reason for this filter is preventing abusive language appearing in
my bot in a language that I don't speak and thus cannot filter out.

### How It Used to Work

At first I struggled with how to retrieve a random commentâ€”the SoundCloud API
doesn't allow for getting random nodes. Then I discovered that track IDs (and
comment IDs) are sequential. I found an old comment ID at `100000000` a recent
one at `500000000`, and figured that 400 million comments was more than enough
of a well from which to draw. The script picks a number at random, checks if
the comment still exists, and passes it on for filtering.

In early 2020, however, the `/comments` endpoint was removed from the SoundCloud
API without notice, so this bot stopped working. In 2023, I finally rewrote the
bot to use the process described above.

## Acknowledgements

I could not have created this bot without help from the following people and
resources:

- [Justin Falcone](https://justinfalcone.com/) provided code review.

- [Twitter user @berlindisaster](https://twitter.com/berlindisaster/status/621943270726344704) also had this idea in July of 2015. (This tweet and account have since been deleted.)

## Afterword

This is my third bot. ([@obliquestions](https://botsin.space/@obliquestions) and [@novelcompounds](https://twitter.com/novelcompounds) are the first two.)
